            <p>Developer for AI Health Monitor Student Innovation Project</p>
            <p>September 2024 - March 2025</p>
            <p>Collaborated on the hardware development team to design and prototype “SnowFall,” an AI-powered wearable health monitoring device that won 1st Place in the “Tech for Good” category at the Toronto Tech Expo 2025, hosted by Slalom.
                Our solution was designed to support elderly individuals by detecting falls in real-time and instantly alerting caregivers. Leveraged Arduino, ESP32, and IoT technologies to develop the wearable prototype, integrating sensor modules to measure key vitals including heart rate, temperature, and oxygen levels.
                Utilized TinkerCAD for rapid prototyping, circuit simulation, and component testing. Integrated AI algorithms and LLM-based chatbot support (Ollama Deepseek 1.5B) to enhance user assistance and enable adaptive responses through prompt engineering.
                Developed IoT-enabled features for secure remote monitoring via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enabling real-time data transfer to cloud platforms and analytics dashboards.
